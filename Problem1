  First Bad Version
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example:

Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version.

    // Set<Integer> ste;

    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {

        // ste=new HashSet<>();

        return binSearch(n,1,n);

    }

    public int binSearch(int n,int st,int end){
11
        // if(!ste.contains(ind))
12
            // System.out.println("called for "+st+" and "+end);
13
        // if(ste.contains(ind))
14
        //     return -1;
15
        if(st<1 || end>n)
16
            return -1;
17
        if(st==end )
18
            return isBadVersion(st)?st:-1;
19
        // ste.add(ind);
20
        int ind=(st/2+end/2);
21
        if(isBadVersion(ind)){
22
            // System.out.println("ind= "+ind);  
23
            if(ind>st){
24
                int y=binSearch(n,st,ind-1);
25
                if(y!=-1)
26
                    return y;
27
            // System.out.println("y=-1 for "+ind/2);
28
            // y=binSearch(n,(ind/2+ind)/2);
29
            // y=binSearch(n,ind+1,end);
30
            // if(y!=-1)
31
            //     return y;
32
            // System.out.println("here returning "+ind);
33
            }
34
            return ind;
35
        }
36
        return binSearch(n,ind+1,end);
37
    }
38
}

The first solution that I thought of was binary search itself as API calls needed to be minimized. 
Got WA on numbers very large and adding them , also first time I had not really considered all test cases carelessly
as to what should happen when start==end or I exceed end etc.
